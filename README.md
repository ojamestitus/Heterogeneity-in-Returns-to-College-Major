# Heterogeneity-in-Returns-to-College-Major

This was a project that I did for undergraduate for a course called Economics Senior Seminar. This project analyzed how an individualâ€™s college major affected their wages using multiple regression. Findings for this project were presented at the Undergraduate Research Conference at Fitchburg State University. Please note that I could not upload the data from ACS to my GitHub because the data set is larger than 100mb. Here's a link to the data set from Google Drive if you are interested: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dwYo79kHjbebDvhIjaxYUF2x12ydJUI5/view?usp=sharing
