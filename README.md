# Heterogeneity-in-Returns-to-College-Major

This was a project that I did for undergraduate for a course called Economics Senior Seminar. This project analyzed how an individualâ€™s college major affected their wages using multiple regression. Findings for this project were presented at the Undergraduate Research Conference at Fitchburg State University. Please note that I could not upload the data from ACS to my GitHub because the data set was too large.
